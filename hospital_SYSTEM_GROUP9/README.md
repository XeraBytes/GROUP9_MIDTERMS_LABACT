## Setup Instructions

### 1. Requirements
- PHP 8.1+
- PostgreSQL 13+
- A local server (XAMPP, Laragon, or PHP built-in server)

### 2. Database Setup
Open your PostgreSQL client (pgAdmin or psql) and run:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE hospital_db;
```
Then import the schema:
```bash
psql -U postgres -d hospital_db -f database.sql
```

### 3. Configure Database Credentials
Open `config/Database.php` and update:
```php
private string $host     = 'localhost';
private string $port     = '5432';
private string $dbname   = 'hospital_db';
private string $user     = 'postgres';
private string $password = 'admin123'; // <-- change this
```

### 4. Run the Server
From the project root:
```bash
php -S localhost:8000
```
